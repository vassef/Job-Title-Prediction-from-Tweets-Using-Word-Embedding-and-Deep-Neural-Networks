# Project Title
Job-Title-Prediction-from-Tweets-Using-Word-Embedding-and-Deep-Neural-Networks

## Description

The more social media take its place in our lives, the
more important their analysis becomes and the more researchers’
attention is drawn to it. Studies contain various topics such as
sentiment analysis, trend prediction, bot detection, etc. Here, for
the first time, we propose a novel method to predict the job title
of social media users. Twitter, a popular social media, is the our
target social media. We introduce a dataset consist of 1314 users’
tweets and bios. The user’s job title is found using Wikipedia
crawling. The challenge of multiple job title per user is handled
using a semantic word embedding and clustering method. Then,
a job prediction method based on a deep neural network and TFIDF word embedding is introduced. We also take the advantage
of hashtags and emojis in the tweets for job prediction. Results
show that the job title of users in Twitter could be well predicted
with 54% accuracy in nine categories.
